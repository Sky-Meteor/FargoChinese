# You may find this .hjson file approach to translations easier for your mod.
# .hjson files contain translations for the language specified in the filename. (Make sure this file is UTF-8 encoded only.)
# The possible languages are: English ("en-US"), German ("de-DE"), Italian ("it-IT"), French ("fr-FR"), Spanish ("es-ES"), Russian ("ru-RU"), Chinese ("zh-Hans"), Portuguese ("pt-BR"), and Polish ("pl-PL")
# Here in ExampleMod we have organized these files in a folder called Localization. A single file per language makes it extremely easy to to integrate and maintain translations.
# Each translation entry in .hjson files contains a key and a value. The key is determined following the rules of JSON [https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_syntax.asp]
# The Key automatically inherits "Mods.ModNameHere.", which is useful to know if you want to use substitutions (as seen in the Paper Airplane example) or use Language.GetTextValue or Network text.
# The following are the currently autogenerated keys: ItemName, ItemTooltip, BuffName, BuffDescription, ProjectileName, NPCName, MapObject, and Prefix

	Fargowiltas: {
		Bestiary: {
			Deviantt: Provides monster spawners and (if she feels like it) a helping hand. This upbeat and energetic creature likes money almost as much as she likes violence. Only a little deformed.
			Abominationn: Can control the weather and stop invasions, but he's lazy and his weapons are fused to his hands. Good thing he doesn't need to eat and doors magically open when he approaches.
			Mutant: Called brother by its siblings, but refuses to confirm its gender. More interested in watching fights and small pets than talking about its past. It seems to be looking for someone strong...
			LumberJack: A wholly ordinary lumberjack that loves collecting critters and chopping wood of any kind. But could there be more to him than meets the eye? Secret godly powers? ...Probably not.
			Squirrel: This dapper critter sells duplicates of valuable items that it notices in inventories. Won't divulge how it gets them, mostly because it can't speak.

					DownedAbom: Hey, you've almost made it to the end! Got all your Soul accessories ready? What's that? You want to fight my big brother? ...maybe if he had a reason to.
					DownedEridanus: Ready to fight my big brother? Remember how you've learned to learn. Stay focused, look for patterns, and don't panic. Good luck!
					PostML: Wanna craft Forces, but missing Enchantments? Craft the Sigil of Champions and they'll give you what you want, so long as you earn it.
					MoonLord: Only a specific type of weapon will work against each specific pillar. As for that moon guy, his weakness will keep changing.
					Cultist: Some powerful enemies like that dungeon guy can create their own arenas. You won't be able to escape, so make full use of the room you do have.
					Fishron: Did you beat that fish pig dragon yet? He reduces your maximum life a little on every hit. He's also strong enough to break defenses in one hit. Too bad you don't have any reinforced plating to prevent that, right?
					Betsy: Now's a good time to go for Betsy! Don't worry. If you reach the last wave and lose, you won't have to retry the event for more attempts at her. Careful not to slip up before then, and mind her debuffs!
					Golem: That temple? Reach the altar to regain wire control! The golem gets upset when you leave, so fighting in there is best. Platforms won't work, but a Lihzahrd Instactuation Bomb can help clear space!
					Plantera: That overgrown plant inflicts a special venom that works her into an enraged frenzy if she stacks enough hits on you. She also has a ring of crystal leaves, but minions go through it.
					Destroyer: That metal worm has a few upgrades, but its probes were downgraded to compensate. It'll start shooting homing dark stars and flying. When it coils around you, don't try to escape!
					Twins: I saw that metal eye spinning while firing a huge laser the other day. Also, even if you kill them, they won't die until they're both killed!
					Prime: Focus on taking down that metal skull, not its limbs. Don't try to outrun its spinning limbs! Keep your eyes open and learn to recognize what's doing what.
					WOF: That thing's mouth is as good as immune to damage, so you'll have to aim for the eye. Only one of them is vulnerable at a time, though. What thing? You know, that thing!
					Deviantt: Next up is me! Make sure you can recognize whatever attack I'll throw at you. Blocks and turning away can nullify petrification!
					Skeletron: The master of the dungeon can use its babies to attack! Which attack it uses depends on whether or not it's spinning. It'll also take a last stand, so be ready to run when you make the kill!
					QueenBee: The queen bee will summon her progeny for backup. She's harder to hurt while they're there, so take them out first. Oh, and her swarm can't hit right above or below her!
					Brain: Focus on how the ichor moves and don't get overwhelmed! When the brain gets mad, it'll confuse you every few seconds. Four rings to confuse you, one ring when it wears off!
					Eater: The more the world eater splits, the more worms can rush you at once. The head is extra sturdy now, but don't let them pile up too much!
					GoblinsCrimson: Watch out when you break your second Crimson Heart! It might attract the goblins, so prepare before you do it.
					GoblinsCorruption: Watch out when you break your second Shadow Orb! It might attract the goblins, so prepare before you do it.
					EOC: That big eyeball has the power of the moon, but it's too flashy for its own good! Learn to notice and focus only on the bits that threaten to hurt you.
					Slime: Gonna fight that slime king soon? Crafting a Mini Instabridge or two might help, and mind the slimy rain. Don't stay up and out of his range or he'll get mad, though!
					// Other
					Auras: Seems like everyone's learning to project auras these days. If you look at the particles, you can see whether it'll affect you at close range or a distance!
					Debuffs: There's probably a thousand items to protect against all these debuffs. It's a shame you don't have a thousand hands to carry them all at once!
					SoulToggle: Don't forget you can turn off your effect toggles! They're all in that little wrench button right below your inventory. Those small buttons at the very bottom of the list include a recommended low-lag preset!
					LifeCrystals: I don't have any Life Crystals for you, but I think my big brother left some in the fat slime king. Maybe he'll share if you beat it up!
					Fish: Watch out for those fish! Sharks will leave you alone if you leave them alone, but piranhas go wild when they smell blood. They can jump out of water to get you!
					Underwater: The water is bogging you down? Never had an issue with it, personally... Have you tried breathing water instead of air?
					Underworld: The underworld has gotten a lot hotter since the last time I visited. I hear an obsidian skull is a good luck charm against burning alive, though!
					SpaceSuffocation: Want to have a breath-holding contest? The empty vacuum of space would be perfect. No, I won't cheat by breathing water instead of air!
					UndergroundHallow: That's a funny face you're making... Is the underground Hallow too disorienting? Try controlling gravity on your own and maybe it can't flip you by force!
					LifeFruit: If you ask me, Plantera is really letting herself go. A diet of Chlorophyte Ore and Life Fruit isn't THAT healthy! Why don't you help her slim down?
					CactusDamage: Those cacti can be pretty prickly! Feeling prickled? Try enchanting yourself with cactus essence and see how it goes!
					RainLightning: Watch out for the lightning when it rains. It's good to pack an umbrella so you're not caught out and end up all wet!
