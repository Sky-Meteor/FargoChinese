		Random13: Witness a true cataclysm.
		Random14: I could recite all the digits of Pi before you beat me.
		Random15: It has only begun.
		Random16: Don't even try to dodge.
		Random17: For centuries I have trained for a fight like this.
		Random18: Purge the weak.
		Random19: Luck won't help you here.

		Quote20: Why am I using this?
		Quote21: Can you keep up?
		Quote22: No matter how many times you fight this battle, you will never win! I am a cruel god of eternity. I wield the branches of Yggdrasil and Ragnorak, the swirling brimstone of Calamity, the ceaseless shadows of Sacred Tools, the blue-tinted Magicks, the hallowed Spirits of arcane lands, the soaring power of ascended Avalon, the all-powerful blessing of the Ultraseer's Nova, the awakened essence of lost Ancients, the all-searing light and shade of the radiant universal Split, the world warping machines and city shaping tools of Lui, and the cosmic convergence that harkens the Old God's Hunt!
		Quote23: Nature unites against you.
		Quote24: The Empress' Excel Assault!
		Quote25: You thought I was done?
		Quote26: YOU ARE NOTHING COMPARED TO THE ERODED SPIRITS! I BRING FORTH THE END UPON THE FOOLISH, THE UNWORTHY! YOU WANT TO DEFEAT ME? MAYBE IN TWO ETERNITIES!!

HELL DOESN'T ACCEPT SCUM LIKE YOU, SO SUFFER FOREVER IN MY ENDLESS ONSLAUGHT OF INFINITE POWER, THE POTENTIAL OF ETERNITIES STRETCHED TO THE ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM APOTHEOSES! YOUR UNHOLY SOUL SHALL BE CONSUMED BY DEPTHS LOWER THAN THE DEEPEST REACHES OF HELL!
		Quote28: I CONTROL THE POWER THAT HAS REACHED FROM THE FAR ENDS OF THE UNIVERSE, UNITING DIMENSIONS, MANIPULATING TERRARIA, SLAYING MASOCHISTS, AND JUDGING HEAVENS! FOR CENTURIES I HAVE TRAINED FOR ONE GOAL ONLY: PURGE THE WORLD OF THE UNWORTHY, SLAY THE WEAK, AND BRING FORTH TRUE POWER. IN THE HIGHEST REACHES OF HEAVEN, MY BROTHER RULES OVER THE SKY! SOON, ALL OF TERRARIA WILL BE PURGED OF THE UNWORTH AND A NEW AGE WILL START! A NEW AGE OF AWESOME! A GOLDEN AGE WHERE ONLY ABSOLUTE BEINGS EXIST!DEATH, INFERNO, TIDE; I AM THE OMEGA AND THE ALPHA, THE BEGINNING AND THE END! ALMIGHTY POWER; REVELATIONS.ABSOLUTE BEING, ABSOLUTE PURITY.
		Quote29: WITHIN THE FOOLISH BANTERINGS OF THE MORTAL WORLD I HAVE ACHIEVED POWER THAT WAS ONCE BANISHED TO THE EDGE OF THE GALAXY! I BRING FORTH CALAMITIES, CATASTROPHES, AND CATACLYSM; ELDRITCH POWERS DERIVED FROM THE ABSOLUTE WORD OF FATE. FEEL MY UBIQUITOUS WRATH DRIVE YOU INTO THE GROUND AS A WORLD SHAPER DRIVES HIS WORLD INTO REALITY!
		Quote30: THE SHARPSHOOTER'S EYE PALES IN COMPARISON OF MY PERCEPTION OF REALITY! BERSERKERS RAGE NAUGHT BUT A BUNNIES! OLYMPIANS A MINOR GOD, ARCH WIZARDS A POSER! A MASTERY OF FLIGHT, THE IRON WILL OF A COLOSSUS; BOTH ELEMENTARY CONCEPTS! A CONJUROR BUT A PEDDLING MAGICIAN, A TRAWLER, A SLIVER COMPARED TO MY LIFE MASTERY? SUPERSONIC SPEED, LIGHTSPEED TIME! GLORIOUS LIGHT SHALL ELIMINATE YOU, YOU FOOLISH BUFFOON!!
